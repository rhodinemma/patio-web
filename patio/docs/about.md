# About PATIO

PATIO is a well-provisioned network measurement and systems research test-bed designed to support Internet measurement, protocol design, and distributed systems research in Africa.

## Background

<!--
“For example, over 50% of the top domains in Brazil and India are hosted in the United States, [...] About half of
Kenyan paths to the top domains traverse the United States and Great Britain (but the same half does not traverse both countries). Much of this phenomenon is due to “tromboning”, whereby an Internet path starts and ends in the same country, yet transits an intermediate country; [...] Infrastructure alone is not enough.
ISPs in respective regions need better incentives to interconnect
with one another to ensure that local traffic stays local.” -->

## PATIO Goals

- Support longitudinal, time-delimited, fine-grained, and
- Coarse-grained measurements
- Well-provisioned and distributed vantage points
- Separate infrastructure development from measurement research
- Support Internet measurement, protocol design, and systems design
