## Research Questions

1. **Impact of Emerging Practices**: What impacts do remote peering and
   anycast by CDNs on internet performance in Africa? There is some evidence
   to suggest that a reason some CDNs avoid open peering is due to the poor
   route quality issues exacerbated by remote peering. Anycast and DNS
   polarization is important to understand particularly for CDNs and provider
   networks.

2. **Edge CDN**. What are models of edge-based operator-run federated
   CDNs for local content? Can we prototype such a mechanism that would look
   like built on-top of a multi-IXP fabric?

3. **Sustainable Cache Fill and Sharing.** Are there sustainable auction mechanisms to support cache sharing and cache fill in cooperative IXPs?

4. **Understanding Traffic Asymmetry.** What is the nature of traffic asymmetry in
   African IXPs. For example, it is known that IXPs have asymmetric paths when sending traffic to a given peer. This means that some traffic will be responded to by a transit AS that does not use the IXP path.Can we build a better understanding of traffic asymmetry at IXPs.

5. **Emerging Data Center Dynamics.** What is the impact of these challenges in the design of data centers, distributed systems such as microservice applications, and protocols in the African setting?
